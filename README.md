# Cryptographic Toolkit
This repository contains a collection of cryptographic tools implemented in Python, designed to enhance security and encryption practices. Whether you're looking to encrypt data, secure communication channels, or test password strength, this toolkit has you covered.

## Projects Included
### AES Encryption
A robust implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for securely encrypting and decrypting data. This tool ensures that sensitive information is protected using industry-standard encryption techniques.

### Main Features:
Supports 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit key sizes.
Provides modes of operation like CBC, CFB, and GCM.
Includes key generation, encryption, and decryption functionalities.

### Hybrid Encryption
A powerful hybrid encryption system that combines the security of asymmetric encryption (RSA) with the efficiency of symmetric encryption (AES). This project demonstrates how to securely exchange data using a combination of public and private keys.

### Main Features:
Implements RSA for secure key exchange.
Utilizes AES for fast and secure data encryption.
Ensures data integrity and confidentiality during transmission.

### Password Hash Cracker
A tool designed to test the strength of hashed passwords by attempting to crack them using various techniques like brute-force and dictionary attacks. This project helps in understanding password vulnerabilities and improving security measures.

### Main Features:
Supports multiple hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, etc.).
Implements brute-force and dictionary-based attacks.
Provides insights into password strength and security.
